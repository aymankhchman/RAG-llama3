# RAG using Llama3

Welcome to the RAG-Llama3 project! This repository demonstrates the powerful integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Llama 3 with Hugging Face to generate authentic Lebanese recipes.

## Project Description

This project involves:
1. **Jaccard Similarity**: Initial retrieval based on text similarity.
2. **Embeddings**: Enhanced context capture using the `Alibaba-NLP/gte-large-en-v1.5` model.
3. **LLM Generation**: Generating detailed Lebanese recipes using Llama 3.

Our dataset includes a variety of traditional Lebanese dishes, showcasing AI's ability to generate recipes based on specific user cravings.

## Usage

Open the `Building_RAG.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and follow the instructions to explore the RAG model's capabilities.

## Project Structure
